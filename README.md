This app is built in Swift, using the Swiftui framework in Xcode.

It uses the open RESTful Pok√©mon API (https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch data and display details of pokemon.

The user can either browse through a list of all the pokemon or choose a pokemon type of his liking. There is also the ability to add a pokemon to your favorites and access its details even when offline.
The initial (fetch all pokemon) call uses seamless pagination of 30 items per call.
